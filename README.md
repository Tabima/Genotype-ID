Genotype-ID
===========

The idea of creating a Shiny server to develop population genetic tool ocurred to us while working on [poppr] (http://github.com/poppr/poppr) on the winter of 2013.

The goals of the Genotype-ID are
* To create an easy framework for the reconstruction and identification on SSR data
* To use [poppr] (https://github.com/poppr/poppr) in a highly efficient way, in order to create web-apps for biologists/researchers everywhere
* To generate a genotyping webpage for species of *Phytopthora*

Species implemented so far
--------------------------
+ *Phytophthora ramorum*



Installation
----------------------

**Genotype-ID** is based on R, it uses:
* The latest [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) version (Version 2.15.3 is currently supported)
* [poppr] (https://github.com/poppr/poppr) package 
* [Shiny server] (https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server) and its dependencies
